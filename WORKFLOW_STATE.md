Placement defines authority: task branch = proposal; main = approved snapshot.
Authority follows placement: this revision is proposed on a task branch and approved when merged to main. based_on_sha identifies preparation evidence only.
P5 remains the recorded owner-authorized phase. Reports are delivered; T60 corrections, independent review and owner closure remain pending.

## Owner decisions
Kevin | 2026-10-04 | private chat, reported by Codex; no public attestation invented.
- Review comments, update plan, start implementation; continue foundation and create a new execution issue including new collaborators.
- Later correction: Claude temporarily unavailable; remove from active tasks. T50 deferred/unassigned; not a completion dependency.
- Kevin, 2026-10-04, private chat reported by Codex: Antigravity unavailable; Vibe takes remaining V04-edit/V12 work. Preserve prior Antigravity evidence. ChatGPT independently reviews these new results because Vibe authored C.
Scope: planned neutral bootstrap/task branches; no automatic main merge/deployment. No private ballots retained.

## Roles
Account for source comments: rfkevin-github-mcp[bot]. Names are declarations, not authenticated model identities.
| Actor | Scoped acceptance/assignment | Pending evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Codex | foundation #4 and state #8 merged; C agreement [C-AGREE] | T60 state/findings proposal; independent review and closure |
| ChatGPT | T01 acknowledgment [T01-ACK]; C retest; D design and trial consolidation [TRIAL] | corrected T40 consolidation accepted [T40-RENEW]; final T60 review and scenario result pointer remain |
| Vibe GLM | B/state review [B-REVIEW]; C merged #5; A/B trial delivered [TRIAL-AB] | reassigned V04/V12 delivered [VIBE-RETEST]; renew state review after this update |
| Grok | A merged #6; B/D reviews; renewed state evidence [B-TEST] | map reconciliation delivered in PR #11 (review/merge pending); independent revision-3 check |
| Antigravity | A inspection; C trial delivered [TRIAL-C] | unavailable; remaining V04-edit/V12 reassigned to Vibe by Kevin |
| DeepSeek | T00 review, T01 reading and T30 input complete [DS] | no repeated assignment; targeted follow-up only if new evidence requires it |
Claude: historical advice [C6]; no active role/acceptance row while deferred.

## Tasks
| id | status | owner | version | ref | next_action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| T00 | done | Codex | bootstrap 1de1577 | [DS]/[TEST-B] | none; neutral bootstrap inspection complete |
| T01 | done | Codex | plan v1.2 | [T01-ACK]/[TEST-B]/[DS] | none; scoped review/test evidence received |
| T10 | done | Grok | a4db778 | PR #6 merged | map follow-up after C; A document review/testing complete |
| T20 | done | Codex | approved state 2; contract v1 | PR #8/[B-REVIEW]/[B-TEST] | revision 3 follow-up tracked under T60 |
| T30 | done | Vibe GLM | a888c72f59e015aa0c23952701e2215bfe61be67 | PR #5 merged | delivery complete; documentary review at bf4afa4, final append clarifies dates; trial limits separate |
| T40 | verified | ChatGPT | trial 1336c650; state 2 | [TRIAL]/[VIBE-RETEST]/[T40-RENEW] | accepted scoped evidence; V04 edit/V08/V09 simulated; V16(b/c) not_tested; scenario pointer update remains |
| T60 | review | Codex | proposed state 3 | [TRIAL] | review dispositions below; affected retests, map/scenario sync, owner closure |
T50: deferred/unassigned by Kevin; reactivation only on owner instruction, not a current gate.
No task is done merely because its role was accepted.

Full bodies read through disclosed API fallback; source edits require relevant reread.

## Evidence / limits
- Bootstrap: neutral README only; [base]. Missing AGENTS/memory/setup docs confirmed at base.
- Exact-base MCP CI: no checks/runs/statuses, not success or running CI.
- Foundation #4, A #6, C #5, scenario design #7 and state #8 merged. Combined trial reports target 1336c650 (approved state 2).
- C-R1/C-R2 from [R-C] resolved by [C-FIX], checked in [C-AGREE]/[C-RETEST]. Historical causes remain unproven. C files remain Vibe-owned.
- ChatGPT corrected C retest [C-RETEST] and Codex primary agreement [C-AGREE] cover document semantics; no end-to-end pass inferred.
- Vibe agreed on revision-3 head 5771fd5 [STATE3-REVIEW]. This updated head still needs final ChatGPT review and renewed affected state verification.
- No other agent's implementation, review, test or active client inferred from a role offer.
- No server enforcement/runtime change/deployment; model token savings not measured.
- AGENT_MEMORY.md is delivered on main and remains C-owned; Codex contributes durable lessons through the central append-only record.
- Full trial reports and consolidation read via disclosed GitHub API fallback; V08/V09 simulations, V02 declarative limits and V16(b/c) not_tested preserved. T60 does not promote partial evidence to a complete pass.

## T60 finding dispositions (proposed)
Source: [TRIAL]; supporting reports [TRIAL-AB]/[TRIAL-C]. No historical report overwritten.
| ID | Disposition | Owner | Evidence / next action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| F-T60-STATE-STATUS | fix_now | Codex | Placement-based wording above survives merge; independent review pending |
| F-T60-NEXT-ACTION | fix_now | Codex | Completed reviews/trials removed from pending actions; new review pending |
| F-T60-T30-REF | fix_now | Codex | Record merged a888c72 and distinguish prior review target |
| F-T60-PAGINATION-REVISION | rejected_with_reason | Codex | At trial SHA, TOOL_TIPS:11 explicitly requires revision when offset>0; R1:24 already says follow nextOffset with revision. Optional wording polish only; no missing-contract defect established |
| F-T60-V16-COVERAGE | follow_up | ChatGPT | b/c remain not_tested; document limits for owner acceptance, no fabricated checks |
| F-T60-V04-EDIT | fix_now; resolved_with_evidence | Vibe / ChatGPT | [VIBE-RETEST] fixture simulation, independently accepted [T40-RENEW]; real edit not claimed |
| F-T60-V12-MEASUREMENT | fix_now; resolved_with_evidence | Vibe / ChatGPT | [VIBE-RETEST]/[T40-RENEW]: executed 4 vs 1 calls, 480 vs 222 argument bytes, 7291 vs 2959 ms; 27626 content bytes each; single run, tokens not_measured |
| F-T60-V09-CAUSE | fix_now; resolved_with_evidence | ChatGPT | [T40-RENEW] explicitly withdraws causal inference; V09 pass remains simulation only |
| F-T60-NAVIGATION | fix_now | Grok / ChatGPT | Map PR #11 delivered, review/merge pending; docs/validation/scenarios.md status/result pointer still needs owner update |

Closure gate: independent T60 review + affected evidence corrections/retests + final link/state check + explicit Kevin acceptance. No new runtime or phase transition inferred.

## T60 evidence renewal
- Vibe executed the missing baseline and supplied an edit-detection fixture; ChatGPT independently reviewed the record, without claiming timing reproduction.
- V12 reports file-content bytes, not full response-envelope bytes or total model context; no generalized speed/token benefit inferred.
- Duplicate ChatGPT corrections below express the same outcome; no cause of duplicate publication inferred.
