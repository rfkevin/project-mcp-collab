Placement defines authority: this file on a task branch is a proposal; it becomes the approved snapshot only when Kevin merges it to main.
Format: CC-STATE-1, parsed by github-mcp src/collab/state.ts (L1). Reference values are plain URLs or paths so that the context tool lists readable sources.
Revision 1 is the P5 opening decided by Kevin on 2026-10-05 and announced in #16 (5994794062); it was never transcribed here. Revision 2 transcribes the cycle as of P6.
History: the CC-1 snapshot (revision 4, P5) stays immutable at main 6507359c; docs/coordination/history/cc1-state-rev4.md points to it. CC-1 is not closed by this file; its owner closure stays pending.

## Owner decisions
Names are declared labels, not authenticated identities. Each line states how the decision reached the record; none is attested by Kevin in public unless linked.
- Kevin, 2026-10-05, coordinator chat, reported by Codex in #16 (5994794062): P5 opened; staging github-mcp branch mcp/105856986/cc2-integration from master cd8089ae; no promotion to master before the final packet and Kevin's decision.
- Kevin, 2026-10-05/06, reported by the substitutes in #16: Codex unavailable; Sol reviews L2 and Vibe reviews L4 in Codex's slot; Grok tests L1, L2 and L6 in place of Muse Spark; Cline unavailable then authors L7 on portalshall.
- Kevin, 2026-10-06, direct instruction in Claude's chat, no public attestation: Claude authors L3 and L6, closes L7/G5 (PR #18) and prepares this state successor for G5-F1.
- Kevin, 2026-10-06, reported by Sol in #16 (6013325692): GPT-5.6 Sol is substitute coordinator for the rest of P6/G5 to G6. Owner authority is not transferred.
- Kevin, 2026-10-06, direct instruction in Claude's chat: the cycle is in P6.
- GPT-5.6 Sol as coordinator, 2026-10-06, reported by Grok in #16 (6013591994): Grok supplies the missing independent tests of L3 and L4 (G5-F6). Not an owner decision.
- Kevin, 2026-10-06, direct instruction in coordinator chat: continue F2 and assign Vibe GLM the real portalshall bootstrap runtime test; GPT-5.6 Sol records G5-F8, with Grok as independent verifier. This does not authorize any main/master merge or production deployment.
Kevin alone decides waivers, gate acceptance, merges to main or master, promotion and deployment.

A task is not done because a role was accepted. done = merged with recorded review and test; verified = review and test recorded, not merged. D12 holds when the tester is neither the owner nor a reviewer of the task; L1 and L3 do not meet it (task D12).
